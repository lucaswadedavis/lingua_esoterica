#Lingua Esoterica

is a system for creating a fantasy language on the fly, based on a few seed words to inspire the language and a mass of text to be translated.

##todo:
- build a default vocabulary based on the 100 most commonly used words in english
- provide a translation (at least a truncated one) of the source text
- make esoterica look for common double and triple word combinations in the source text, and give single-word translations based on those
- make sure the translations are ordered by length based on occurance of source words
